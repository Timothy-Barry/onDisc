Description: Single-cell datasets are growing in size, posing challenges as well as opportunities to genomics researchers. `ondisc` is an R package for computing on large-scale single-cell data. `ondisc` enables the analysis of single-cell data out-of-core on a laptop or distributed across multiple nodes on a computing cluster. In both settings `ondisc` requires only a few gigabytes of memory, even if the input data are tens of gigabytes in size. `ondisc` is oriented toward single-cell differential expression, single-cell co-expresssion, and single-cell CRISPR screen analyses.
