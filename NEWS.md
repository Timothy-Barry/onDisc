# Version 1.2.0

Version 1.2.0 represents the first stable release of `ondisc` since we completely rewrote the package. `ondisc` v1.2.0 features two data import functions: `create_odm_from_cellranger()` and `create_odm_from_r_matrix()`. Additionally, `ondisc` provides several functions for interacting with an `odm` object, including `dim()`, `rownames()`, and the `[,]` operator.
